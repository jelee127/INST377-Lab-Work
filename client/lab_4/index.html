<!-- Bring in your successful HTML/CSS from the Flexbox lab -->
<!-- Try typing 'doc' at the top of this file and pressing "tab" -->
<!-- if your development environment is set up correctly -->
<!-- the Emmett plugin will set this file up for you -->

<!-- Requirements -->
<!-- Your page will need a form in it with an 'action' to /api and 
    a single text field with an id/name of "resto" -->
<!-- If you open /routes/apiRoutes and go to line 38 you will find 
    the server side answer to your request! -->

<!-- This week doesn't have a script.js file in it, 
    because you're focusing on HTML and CSS -->
